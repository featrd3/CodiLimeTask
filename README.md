# CodiLimeTask
CodiLimeTask, React application based on received .fig file.

# Notes:
I am aware that most of spacing is not aligning 100% according to .fig file.
Under normal circumstances I would reach out to person responsible for .fig and ask which elements are supposed to scale with window size, and which are constant.
Also I did not like how some elements were not aligned to left. Again, I would just reach out to know if this was done on purpose and should be kept in fonal product.

I was also not sure if Section_2 was supposed to have option for expanding on click, so I left simple functionality just in case.
Unless example provided links, I did not code any buttons/navigation.

I set up base for React-router.

Provided example in Section_4 suggests that navigation is done via "View details" while I personally make entire "rectangle" the link.
